## Universal

With the AppBuilder universal desktop client, you can develop hybrid and NativeScript cross-platform mobile apps from your desktop (OS X or Windows). You can download and install the universal desktop client from [https://platform.telerik.com/appbuilder/webclient/#/downloads](https://platform.telerik.com/appbuilder/webclient/#/downloads).

### Clone the sample

1. (Optional) Provide description.
1. Click **Create app** and wait for the in-browser client to load the app.

A new app is added in your Telerik Platform account and all files are checked into the integrated AppBuilder version control. Third-party version control is configured and your app is connected to the repository from which you cloned it. The universal desktop client opens the code for your new app and lists all app files in the Project Navigator.
